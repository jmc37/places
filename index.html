        <ul style="list-style-type:none; margin-bottom: 20 px;">
            <div class="restaurant">
        <li >Savio Volpe</li>
        <img src="images/Savio Volpe.webp" alt=""> 
        <div class="review">Savio Volpe is a restaurant styled after the classic osteria; rustic fare in the Italian tradition of freshness and regionality, using groceries gathered in the nearby lakes, oceans, farms and fields. Everything is prepared in the simplest, most flavourful way; pasta is handmade fresh every day – fatta a mano in casa – and meat, poultry and fish are kissed by smoke over the wood-fired grill and rotisserie. And of course, a long list of friendly Italian wines and old world coffee to inspire conversation and good cheer. Above all else, Savio celebrates liveliness, warmth and hospitality. Viva la convivialità!</div>
        <li>Ask for Luigi</li>
        <img src="images/luigi-front-page.png" alt="">
        <div class="review">Ask for Luigi is a casual and intimate Italian-inspired restaurant, specializing in fresh hand made pasta.*

        The service is family-style: all dishes are meant for sharing and food arrives to the middle of the table, as it is ready. The antipasti usually arrive first, with pasta dishes close behind. We also have an amazing house made gluten free options available daily. All menu items are available for dine-in or take-out.</div>        
        <li>Tasty's</li>
        <img src="images/Tastys.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Refined eatery offering Indian dishes & tandoori fare, plus patio seating & craft cocktails.</div>
        <li> Vijs</li>
        <img src="images/vij-s-restaurant.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Vikram Vij opened Vij’s restaurant in Vancouver in 1994, with Meeru Dhalwala joining him soon after to collaborate on a menu that would change the landscape of Indian cuisine in Canada. Using traditional Indian methods, spices and culinary influences, and pairing them with sustainable, local produce from British Columbia, they created one of the best-known and most beloved Indian restaurants in North America. Vikram's first solo restaurant, My Shanti, opened in South Surrey in 2014. Located at the destination shopping location Morgan Crossing, My Shanti pays homage to Vikram’s travels around India.</div>
        <li>Menya Itto</li>
        <img src="images/menya itto.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Yukihiko Sakamoto is the founder, master, and owner of Menya Itto, who trained under “Son of Ramen God” Koji Tashiro, a disciple of the legendary “Ramen God” and tsukemen inventor Kazuo Yamagishi. Sakamoto has been in Vancouver and in the kitchen of the first Canadian outpost of Menya Itto, to train the staff and ensure the broth, handmade thick and thin noodles, and garnishes meet his exacting standards.</div>
        <li>The diamond</li>
        <img src="images/the diamond.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Bustling craft cocktail lounge with old-world charm overlooking Maple Tree Square.</div>
        <li>Lao Wai</li>
        <img src="images/Laowai.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">All one has to do to gain access to the hideaway is step inside BLND TGER – where there are six numbered dumpling options from chef Phong Vo (all delicious, by the way, especially the tongue-numbing, pork-filled Zhongs) – and ask for “the number 7”. There’s no secret handshake or real sense of gatekeeping to keep the seemingly uncool out. It’s just the axel upon which the whole concept turns, not too dissimilar from Manhattan’s Please Don’t Tell or London’s Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town.</div>
        <li>Au Comptoir</li>
        <img src="images/Au comptoir.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Our menus change with the seasons to highlight the bounty of incredible produce our local growers bring us. The passionate team in the kitchen — led by Chef Daniel McGee and Sous-Chef Matt Eaton — work hard to showcase their collective skills and vision creating contemporary dishes rooted in classic French technique. Our servers provide an experience unlike any other in the city, while our Pastry Chef Clément Barbier puts a lot of love into the pastries and desserts — a perfect way to start your morning, or end your meal.</div>
        <li>Miku</li>
        <img src="images/Miku.jpeg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Miku Vancouver specializes in Aburi, or flamed-seared, sushi, which was developed nearly a century ago in Japan. The act of applying fire directly to sushi enhances the natural flavours and textures of the fish, creating a new and exciting culinary experience. Miku owner Seigo Nakamura innovated the Aburi concept by crafting specialty sauces using non-traditional Japanese ingredients to pair with each type of fish. The light sear from the binchotan (Japanese bamboo charcoal) caramelizes the sauce, releasing a smoky aroma and bringing out the finest flavours in each piece of Aburi sushi. </div>
        <li>Gothams</li>
        <img src="images/Gothams.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">An American style steakhouse and cocktail bar featuring tender steaks and stiff drinks. Gotham features soaring ceilings, sumptuous leather and velvet upholstery, private dining rooms, an award-winning wine list and exceptional service.</div>
        <li>Autostrada</li>
        <img src="images/Autostrada.jpeg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Here’s the drill with Autostrada food — pasta dishes take centre stage, and some have fresh house-made pasta and others use the dried Rusticello brand. As this kitchen is the largest of the three, they can do more, like specials and braised meats such aspork cheeks and short ribs, to excite the pasta dishes. The food is hearty and honest and straight-forward in the Italian way.</div>
        <li>Khargan</li>
        <img src="images/Khargan.jpeg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Really good Persian food</div>
        <li>Espana</li>
        <img src="images/Espana.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">Low-lit, intimate tapas bar with locally sourced, Spanish small plates, sherries & craft cocktails.</div>
        <li>La Mezcaleria</li>
        <img src="images/La Mezcaleria.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="review">FOUNDED IN 2013, LA MEZCALERIA SERVES TRULY AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FARE INSPIRED BY THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF MEXICO. USING ORGANIC, LOCALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE RESTAURANT OFFERS APPROACHABLE AND SHAREABLE DISHES SUCH AS CEVICHES, QUESOS FUNDIDO, GRILLED SEAFOOD AND MEAT PARRILLADAS.</div>
        <li> Kissa Tanto</li>
        <img src="images/Kissa tanto.webp" alt="">
        <div class="review">Italian-Japanese cuisine & cocktails served in a chic space inspired by 1960s Tokyo jazz cafes.</div>
